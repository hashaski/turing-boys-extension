# turing-boys-extension
## Objective
As programmers, we know the hussle of learning with videos and tutorials. Code is shown in the screen and you need to copy word by word to test it. And when it runs, you may not know how it's working.

So, we decided to create an extension that displays the code that once was an image. You can also edit the code and see the result in real time.
